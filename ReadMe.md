•	Implemented a media synopsis algorithm that produces a “synopsis image” summarizing media content. Picked spotlight frame according to corresponding audio level analysis. Extracted important sub areas from selected frames based on Seam Carving algorithm and Face Detection, then combined them to a synopsis image.

•	Created an interactive player that can interact with this “synopsis” image so that clicking on some location of the synopsis image would trigger the corresponding video to play (with audio synchronized) from that contextual location or show the corresponding image.
